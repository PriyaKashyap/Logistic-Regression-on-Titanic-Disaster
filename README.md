# Logistic-Regression-on-Titanic-Disaster
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  With the help of this data set of details of people information who survived or not can summarize on which factors effected their survival.

With the help of logistic I got Accuracy Score of 77 with the same specificity and sensitivity.

I will now woking on this Dataset with the help of Decision Tree or other algorithms.
